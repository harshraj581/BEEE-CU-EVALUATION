                                                                                     BEEE LAB EVALUATION


AIM  : DESIGN AUTOMATIC LED DIWALI LIGHTS(CONSISTING OF 6 LED'S) SUCH THAT IT ONLY WORKS DURING NIGHT AND CAN GENERATE TWO PATTERNS WHICH CAN BE TOGGLED WITH A SWITCH 
                A- PATTERN 1  LED BLINKS WITHA FREQUENCY OF 500 MILLISEC
                B PATTERN 2 LED BLINKS WITH A FREQUENCY 1 SEC.

APPARATUS REQUIRED :-    1. 6 LED
                         2. ARDUINO UNO
                         3. BREADBOARD
                         4. 2 SWITCH

THEORY : 
	Stands for "Light-Emitting Diode." An LED is an electronic device that emits light when an electrical current is passed through it. 
        Early LEDs produced only red light, but modern LEDs can produce several different colors, including red, green, and blue (RGB) light.
	Recent advances in LED technology have made it possible for LEDs to produce white light as well.

	LEDs are commonly used for indicator lights (such as power on/off lights) on electronic devices. 
	They also have several other applications, including electronic signs, clock displays, and flashlights. 
	Since LEDs are energy efficient and have a long lifespan (often more than 100,000 hours), they have begun to replace traditional light bulbs in several areas. 
	Some examples include street lights, the red lights on cars, and various types of decorative lighting. 
	You can typically identify LEDs by a series of small lights that make up a larger display. 
	For example, if you look closely at a street light, you can tell it is an LED light if each circle is comprised of a series of dots.

         When the switch is pressed then led will glow in pattern 1 and when the switch is released then led will glow in pattern 2.
         So now let us check how arduino code runs .
         When the switch is pressed then a high signal is given to digital pin of arduino , then there is a 'if else' statement 
         that if arduino senses a high signal then it send signal to the other pin to start blinking of led in pattern 1 else in pattern 2.
          

STEPS:- 
	 1. First make the circuit according to the diagram 
	 2. Then code it .
         int i=0;
         void setup()
	{
	  pinMode(8,INPUT);
	  pinMode(9,INPUT);
	  pinMode(1, OUTPUT);
	  pinMode(2, OUTPUT);
	  pinMode(3, OUTPUT);
	  pinMode(4, OUTPUT);
	  pinMode(5, OUTPUT);
	  pinMode(6, OUTPUT);
	  }

	void loop()
	{
	  if(digitalRead(8)==HIGH)
	  {
	    for(i=1;i<=6;i++)
	    {
	  digitalWrite(i, HIGH);
	  delay(500); 
	  digitalWrite(i, LOW);
	  delay(500); 
    }
  }
    else if(digitalRead(9)==HIGH)
      {
      for(i=1;i<=6;i++)
      {
	 digitalWrite(i, HIGH);
	  delay(1000); 
	  digitalWrite(i, LOW); 
	  delay(1000); 

    }
}
}
        
CONLUSION : It will make you to make this type of stuffs according to your requirements .
